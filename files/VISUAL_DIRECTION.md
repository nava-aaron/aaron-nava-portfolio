## COLOR PALETTE

### Primary Colors

**Background:** White (#FFFFFF) or off-white (#F9F9F9)

**Text:** Black (#000000) or dark charcoal (#1A1A1A)

**Rationale:** Clean, professional, elite-level. No color trends. Timeless.

### Accent Colors (Optional)

**Primary accent:** One restrained color for buttons and links
- Options: Deep blue (#003366), dark teal (#1B4C5E), or charcoal
- Use sparingly (only on buttons, hover states, occasional highlights)

**Secondary backgrounds:** Very light gray (#F5F5F5) or light beige (#FAF8F5)
- Use to separate sections subtly
- Creates visual hierarchy without being distracting

### Testimonial/Quote Styling

**Option A:** Simple italics on light background
**Option B:** Subtle left border (thin line) + indentation
**Option C:** Card-based (light background, subtle border)

**Recommendation:** Option B or C - keeps it clean but gives structure

## TYPOGRAPHY

### Font Stack Recommendation

**Headings (H1, H2, etc.):**
- First choice: Inter (modern, clean, professional)
- Fallback: Helvetica Neue or San Francisco
- Weight: Bold (700) for main headings
- Style: All caps OR title case (but decide and stay consistent)

**Body Text:**
- First choice: Inter or Roboto (modern, highly readable)
- Fallback: San Francisco or system fonts
- Weight: Regular (400) for body, Medium (500) for emphasis
- Line-height: 1.6-1.8 (generous for readability)

**Why:** Both modern sans-serif fonts. Clean. Professional. No distracting serifs.

### Size Hierarchy

**H1 (Hero/Main Heading):** 48px - 64px
- Your name, major section headers
- Bold, spacious, immediately commands attention

**H2 (Section Heading):** 32px - 40px
- Subsection headers
- Bold, clear

**H3 (Supporting Heading):** 24px - 28px
- Tertiary headers
- Medium weight

**Body Text:** 16px - 18px
- Comfortable reading size
- Not too small, not too large
- Regular weight

**Small Text (Captions, metadata):** 14px
- Names, titles, dates
- Regular weight

---

## LAYOUT & SPACING

### Page Width

**Desktop:** Max-width 1200px (centered with generous margins)
- Prevents lines from getting too long (hard to read)
- Leaves room for white space

**Margin:** 60px-80px on sides
- Generous. Spacious. Elite.

### Section Spacing

**Between sections:** 100px-120px vertical padding
- Sections feel separate, distinct
- Creates rhythm as user scrolls
- Lots of breathing room

**Within sections:** 40px-60px between elements
- Consistent, logical spacing
- Not cramped

### Grid System

**Desktop:** 12-column grid (standard)
- Flexible for different layouts
- Professional structure

**Mobile:** Single column (everything stacks)
- 20px-30px padding on sides
- Readable width maintained

---

## PHOTOGRAPHY & VISUAL ELEMENTS

### Hero Photo (Your Photo)

**Style:** Professional, authentic, confident (not overly formal or stuffy)

**Placement:** Right side of hero section (on desktop)

**Size:** Large enough to be prominent, but doesn't dominate

**Framing:** Head-to-shoulders or three-quarter length

**Background:** Clean, simple (white or neutral)

**Tone:** Warm, approachable, professional. Not stiff.

### Icons & Graphics (Minimal)

**General rule:** Less is more. Your words are the star.

**Use sparingly for:**
- Navigation (if needed)
- Section breaks (subtle dividers)
- Call-to-action buttons

**Avoid:**
- Illustrated mascots
- Stock photography (except your own photo)
- Decorative graphics
- Anything that feels "designed"

### Visual Breaks Between Sections

**Option A:** Subtle line divider (thin, light gray)
**Option B:** Background color change (white to light gray to white)
**Option C:** Generous white space alone (spacing does the work)

**Recommendation:** Option B or C - most minimal and modern

---

## BUTTONS & INTERACTIVE ELEMENTS

### Primary Button (CTA)

**Style:** Solid color, minimal styling
- Background: Your accent color
- Text: White or light
- Padding: 14px 28px (comfortable to tap/click)
- Border-radius: 4px or slight (not fully rounded, not square)
- Hover state: Slightly darker shade of same color

**Font:** Same as body text, medium weight, 16px

**Example:** "Let's Talk" button

### Secondary Button / Links

**Style:** Text-only or minimal border
- Color: Match your accent color or black
- Hover state: Underline or slight color change
- No background color

**Example:** "View LinkedIn" links

### Form Fields (If applicable)

**Style:** Subtle border, lots of padding
- Border: Light gray, 1px
- Padding: 12px-16px
- Font: 16px (prevents zoom on mobile)
- Placeholder text: Light gray, clear and helpful

---

## RESPONSIVE DESIGN

### Breakpoints

**Desktop:** 1200px and above
- Full layout as designed
- Generous spacing

**Tablet:** 768px - 1199px
- Adjusted spacing, but still spacious
- Navigation may adjust

**Mobile:** Below 768px
- Single column everything
- Navigation becomes hamburger menu
- Text remains large and readable
- Photos scale appropriately
- Buttons remain large (touch-friendly)

### Mobile Considerations

- All text remains readable (no font size below 14px)
- Line lengths stay comfortable (not too wide)
- Buttons are at least 44px tall (touch target)
- Spacing remains generous (not cramped on small screens)
- Images scale proportionally

---

## VISUAL HIERARCHY EXAMPLES

### What Should Stand Out Most?

1. **Your name** (H1 in hero) - Largest, boldest
2. **Positioning statement** - Large, bold, clear
3. **Case study headlines** - 32px, bold
4. **Metrics/numbers** - Bold, slightly larger than body text
5. **Testimonial quotes** - Italicized, maybe slightly larger
6. **Call-to-action button** - Solid color, stands out

### What Should Be Secondary?

1. Navigation - Small, clean, subtle
2. Body text - Standard size
3. Section dividers - Very subtle
4. Supporting copy - Standard size
5. Footer - Small, light

- Headings clearly larger
- No text smaller than 12px

### Links
