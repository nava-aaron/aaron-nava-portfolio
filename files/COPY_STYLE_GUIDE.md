## Overview

This document defines how to write copy for Aaron's portfolio website. It's the voice/tone rulebook for Anti-Gravity and anyone else contributing to the site.

**The goal:** Every word on the site sounds like Aaron. Warm, direct, intelligent, witty, zero jargon.

---

## CORE VOICE PRINCIPLES

### 1. Warm, Friendly, Approachable

You lead with warmth. People like you immediately.

**This means:**
- Use conversational language
- Sound like a peer, not an authority
- Be inviting, not standoffish
- Show you understand the reader's challenges

**Example:**

❌ **Bad:** "I specialize in the operationalization of enterprise-scale growth systems."

✅ **Good:** "I take fragmented mess and turn it into a machine that works."

---

### 2. Direct & Straightforward

No fluff. No corporate speak. Say what you mean.

**This means:**
- Short sentences. Medium sentences. Then longer ones. Vary it.
- Get to the point quickly
- Don't qualify every statement ("kind of," "somewhat," "in some cases")
- Be confident, not wishy-washy

**Example:**

❌ **Bad:** "Through a series of strategic initiatives and operational improvements, I have facilitated the growth of various organizational capabilities."

✅ **Good:** "I've grown four different departments from startup to scale."

---

### 3. Clever & Witty (But Not Forced)

You have good observations. Use them naturally.

**This means:**
- Humor is okay, but it should feel natural, not punchy
- Light observations about how the world works
- Don't try too hard to be funny
- Witty is observational, not preachy

**Example:**

❌ **Bad:** "Most people are idiots, but I'm different."

✅ **Good:** "Most leaders are maintainers who manage existing teams. I'm not that. I build things."

---

### 4. Zero Jargon

This is non-negotiable.

**This means:**
- No "agentic workflows"
- No "commercial architecture"
- No "operationalize"
- No "synergistic leverage"
- No "strategic initiatives"
- If a CEO wouldn't use it in a board meeting, don't use it

**The rule:** If your 70-year-old grandfather wouldn't understand it, remove it.

**Example:**

❌ **Bad:** "I architect scalable commercial systems via agentic AI-enabled workflows."

✅ **Good:** "I build systems that let teams work faster without losing quality."

---

### 5. CEO-Level Simplicity

Simplest language. Simplest analogies.

**This means:**
- Short words over long words
- Common words over fancy words
- Analogies that anyone understands
- Avoid technical references unless absolutely necessary

**Example:**

❌ **Bad:** "I facilitate the paradigmatic shift from decentralized ad hoc processes to unified operational infrastructure."

✅ **Good:** "I take five different ways of doing things and make it one way that works."

---

## TONE BY SECTION

### HERO Section Tone

**Feel:** Confident, immediate, powerful

**Voice:** Bold and direct. No explanation needed. Pure positioning.

**Length:** Short. 1-2 sentences max.

**Personality level:** High (this is where you introduce yourself)

**Example:**
"I close major business. I build the systems to deliver. I do it without breaking the culture or the margin."

---

### THE FULL ARC Section Tone

**Feel:** Clear-headed, intelligent, straightforward

**Voice:** Like explaining to a peer why your approach works. Editorial but warm.

**Length:** 3-4 medium paragraphs

**Personality level:** Medium-high (conversational, but still professional)

**Example:**
"I'm brought in to close major opportunities. $3M-$20M formal RFP processes. Once I'm in the room, I have a 90% conversion rate from first call to RFP invitation, and an 85% win rate on the deal itself."

---

### CASE STUDIES Section Tone

**Feel:** Real, specific, human

**Voice:** Narrative. Use "I" and "we." Include conflict and resolution. Show personality.

**Length:** Medium (300-500 words per case study)

**Personality level:** High (this is where you tell real stories)

**Example:**
[See CASE_STUDIES_FINAL.md for full examples]

---

### WHAT PEOPLE SAY Section Tone

**Feel:** Authentic, credible, not salesy

**Voice:** Don't edit. Let the testimonials speak for themselves. Just pull the most powerful quotes.

**Length:** Short (1-2 sentences per testimonial)

**Personality level:** Low (this is third-party voice, not yours)

**Example:**
"When pitches get intense, Aaron stays calm, focused, and constructive. He understands both the creative and business sides, which is rare."

---

### ABOUT Section Tone

**Feel:** Reflective, authentic, humble

**Voice:** Personal. Use "I." Include learnings, growth moments, vulnerability.

**Length:** Medium (500-800 words)

**Personality level:** Highest (this is the most personal section)

**Example:**
"I've never been good at maintaining. I'm a builder. Always have been. My career has been four major builds—each one bigger, messier, more complex than the last."

---

### LET'S TALK Section Tone

**Feel:** Open, inviting, confident

**Voice:** Direct, warm. Not salesy. Just: "Here's how to reach me."

**Length:** Very short (2-3 sentences)

**Personality level:** Medium (friendly but professional)

**Example:**
"I'm looking for roles where I can drive growth and build systems at scale. If you're at a platform, a major agency, or scaling fast—and you need someone who closes deals and builds infrastructure—let's connect."

---

## SPECIFIC WORDS TO AVOID

### Corporate Jargon

❌ Operationalize, optimize, leverage, synergy, paradigm shift, strategic initiative, drive alignment, circle back, touch base, ping, low-hanging fruit

### Consultant Speak

❌ Best practices, stakeholder engagement, value proposition, thought leadership, key takeaway, moving the needle, at scale, at the end of the day

### Overused Adjectives

❌ Innovative, dynamic, cutting-edge, world-class, award-winning (unless it's literally true and relevant), next-level

### Weak Words

❌ Kind of, somewhat, sort of, in some cases, perhaps, arguably, arguably, it could be argued that

### Passive Voice

❌ "It is believed that..." "It can be argued that..." "Considerations were made..."

✅ Instead: "I believe..." "We decided..."

---

## SPECIFIC WORDS/PHRASES TO EMBRACE

### Strong, Simple Verbs

✅ Build, close, grow, scale, deliver, fix, solve, orchestrate, develop, teach, manage, lead

### Direct Language

✅ I did, we created, you'll see, here's what happened, the problem was, the turning point was

### Specificity

✅ Instead of "grew significantly," say "$25M to $115M"
✅ Instead of "built a team," say "grew from 6 to 100 people"
✅ Instead of "improved efficiency," say "cut delivery costs by 30%"

### Simple Analogies

✅ "A machine that works"
✅ "Getting all the pieces to talk to each other"
✅ "Making the invisible visible"
✅ "Turning chaos into discipline"

### Contractions

✅ Use them. "I'm," "we've," "don't," "can't" - sounds more conversational

### Short, Punchy Sentences

✅ Mix them with longer ones. "I build systems. I close deals. I develop teams that can run without me. That's the pattern."

---

## WRITING MECHANICS

### Sentence Structure

**Rule:** Vary it. Short sentence. Medium. Long flowing sentence. Short again.

**Bad (all medium):** "I have built multiple departments from startup to scale. I have managed global P&Ls. I have integrated complex organizations. I have developed people who lead independently."

**Good (varied):** "I build. I've scaled from 6 people to 1,200. I've integrated 33 agencies into one operating model across four continents. I develop teams that can run without me."

### Paragraph Length

**Rule:** 2-4 sentences per paragraph. Short paragraphs. Lots of white space.

**Why:** Easier to read. Feels modern. Matches your visual aesthetic (elite, clean, spacious).

### Numbers & Metrics

**Rule:** Always include them. Specific is better than round. But keep them readable.

**Good:**
- "6 to 100 people in 2 years"
- "$25-35M to $115M"
- "85% win rate"
- "15-20% YoY growth for 4 consecutive years"

**Avoid:**
- "Significant growth"
- "Substantially increased"
- "Massive scale"

Numbers are your proof. Use them liberally.

### Capitalization & Formatting

**Rule:** Keep it simple and consistent.

- Capitalize proper nouns (Monks, Circus, Spotify, etc.)
- Don't overuse ALL CAPS or bold for emphasis
- Use bold sparingly for key metrics or headings only
- Use italics for quotes from testimonials

### Punctuation

**Rule:** Use em dashes, not semicolons. Parentheses for asides. Ellipses for pauses (sparingly).

**Good:** "I build systems... and then I hand them off."

**Avoid:** "I build systems; then I hand them off." (too formal)

---

## THE "DON'T" LIST

### Don't Use:
- Sales language ("You won't want to miss this," "Limited time," "Exclusive")
- Hype language ("Revolutionary," "Game-changing," "Disrupting")
- Self-aggrandizing language ("The best," "Better than everyone," "The only one")
- Defensive language ("Some people say..." "Critics argue...")
- Apologetic language ("I'm sorry to..." "Forgive me for...")
- Fake modesty ("Just a humble builder..." "I'm no genius...")

### DO Use:
- Confidence without arrogance
- Specificity over generality
- Action words over passive description
- Real metrics over vague claims
- Warmth without neediness

---

## STYLE EXAMPLES: BAD vs. GOOD

### Example 1: Describing Your Win Rate

❌ **Bad:** "I have demonstrated exceptional competency in the domain of business pursuits, with a validated track record of consistent success rates exceeding industry norms."

✅ **Good:** "I close 85% of major deals. That's not luck. That's discipline."

---

### Example 2: Describing Your Scaling Experience

❌ **Bad:** "Throughout my tenure in various capacities, I have leveraged organizational best practices and strategic initiative frameworks to facilitate scalable growth across multiple operational domains."

✅ **Good:** "I've built four different departments from startup to scale. Each time, I've installed the systems that let them run without me."

---

### Example 3: Describing an Integration Challenge

❌ **Bad:** "The post-acquisition integration presented significant stakeholder alignment challenges that required comprehensive change management and organizational restructuring initiatives."

✅ **Good:** "I walked into a room where 16 founders all thought their team was better than the next. I showed them the math. Eventually, they believed."

---

### Example 4: Describing Your Approach

❌ **Bad:** "I implement a comprehensive, multi-faceted approach to organizational development that synthesizes operational excellence with cultural preservation."

✅ **Good:** "I build the systems. I develop the people. I do it without killing the culture."

---

## THE VOICE CHECKLIST

Before you finalize ANY copy, ask:

- [ ] **Would a CEO say this?** (Or does it sound like a consultant?)
- [ ] **Is it specific?** (Numbers, real examples, not vague claims)
- [ ] **Is it warm?** (Conversational, approachable, not stiff)
- [ ] **Is it clear?** (My 70-year-old grandfather would understand)
- [ ] **Does it sound like Aaron?** (Not generic, has personality)
- [ ] **Is there any jargon?** (If yes, remove it)
- [ ] **Is it varied?** (Short sentences mixed with longer ones)
- [ ] **Does it avoid hype?** (No "revolutionary," no "best," no sales language)

If you answer NO to any of these, revise.

---

## FINAL PRINCIPLE

**Your copy should make someone think:** "This person is smart, warm, direct, and doesn't waste time. I want to work with them."

Not: "This person is impressive and uses big words."

Keep it simple. Keep it real. Keep it you.
