# Aaron Nava — Brand Positioning Document
*Updated February 2026 · Final Version*

## Core Brand Voice & Tone

Conversational with contractions. Use varied sentence lengths. Short, punchy sentences. Long, flowing ones. Natural pauses. Simple language. You are talking to a friend. Use plain metaphors. No jargon. Show you understand the reader. Keep it human. Connect emotionally first. Provide value second.

CEO-level clarity. Plain analogies. No music industry references. Speak like an executive to an executive.

Confidence without ego. Be strong. Be direct. Avoid arrogance. Let facts speak. No over-selling. No em dashes.

## Hero / Main Positioning

*"Most executives can close the deal. Or build the system. Or develop the team. Few can do all three. At scale. Without breaking what matters. That's the job. And I've done it four times."*

Followed by the 5-line signature stack:

*Close the business. Build the systems. Develop the teams. Protect the culture. Preserve the margin. That's how I work.*

## Extended Positioning

Most people are built for one thing. I was built for all of it.

Before a pitch begins, someone has to make the case for why your agency belongs in the room. That's where I thrive. The hard questions, the honest answers, the moment where trust either forms or it doesn't. 90% of those conversations turn into a formal invitation to pitch. Then we win 85% of those. We're talking $1.5M to $20M deals. The kind that change a company's trajectory.

I build things. I always have. My career consists of four major builds. Each one was bigger and more complex than the last. I've taken teams from 6 people to 1,200. Grown a $35M capability to $115M. Maintained 15-20% organic growth for four straight years. Integrated 33 agencies into one unified go-to-market. I do not just build. I win. I deliver. I develop people. I stay calm. Results speak for themselves.

## The Pattern — Full Arc

- **Close:** 90% conversion to pitch. 85% win rate on major deals ($1.5M to $20M).
- **Build:** Create the operating systems that scale without breaking the culture.
- **Deliver:** Stay in the work. Manage the client. Ensure execution.
- **Develop:** Build teams that run things on their own.
- **Stabilize:** Bring order to chaos. Handle the M&A and restructures.

This is rare. Most people sell and leave. Most operators do not talk to clients. I do both.

## Key Differentiators

- **The Closer:** 90% conversion rate. I do not waste time.
- **The Builder:** 4 major builds from zero. I know how to scale.
- **The Integrator:** 33 agencies unified. I translate between silos.
- **The Stabilizer:** I stay calm under pressure.
- **The Developer:** I do not hoard knowledge. I train the leaders who follow me.
- **No Ego:** Relentless focus. Results speak for themselves.
- **Tech-Forward:** MIT certification in AI and Business Strategy. Actively building agentic workflows.
- **The Four P's Philosophy:** Profit is the outcome, not the objective. People first. Then product. Then partners. The numbers follow. This is the belief system behind every build.

## Why This Positioning Works for Each Buyer

### Platform Companies (Amazon, Google, LinkedIn, Spotify, Adobe)
**Their Need:** Leaders who manage complex partner relationships and build operational infrastructure.

**Your Angle:** I spent 15 years on the vendor side. I know what enterprise customers struggle with. I build the backbone that turns platform relationships into predictable revenue.

**The Proof:** Monks. 1,200 people. Global capability. I turn chaos into a machine.

### Publicis / Razorfish & Major Holding Companies
**Their Need:** High-volume wins and the ability to integrate smaller teams into the larger organization.

**Your Angle:** I have scaled companies at every stage. I grow fast without killing the culture. I win the business. I make sure it gets delivered.

**The Proof:** Circus (6 to 100) and Monks ($35M to $115M). I lived these scaling challenges.

### Inflection-Point Companies (Series B-D, Scaling Rapidly)
**Their Need:** An architect for the next phase of growth.

**Your Angle:** I have the blueprint. I know what breaks during scale. I am the leader who turns founder-led chaos into a professional operation.

**The Proof:** The Circus case study. 6 people to 100. P&L discipline. Ready for acquisition in 18 months.

### Selective Startups (Strong Revenue, Real Funding)
**Their Need:** A leader to install the systems the founder cannot.

**Your Angle:** I have built departments from scratch to global scale. I specialize in the transition phase. I stop the founder from being the bottleneck.

**The Proof:** My entire career. Conill. Circus. Monks.

## What NOT to Say

- Do not call yourself a "growth specialist." It is too narrow.
- Do not call yourself an "operational expert." It sounds like a back-office role.
- Avoid music or ship metaphors — exception: pirate ship vs navy ship model is approved for specific use in Monks closing line only.
- Do not over-emphasize M&A to companies that are not acquiring.
- Do not focus on your career arc. Focus on their problems.
- Use no jargon. Avoid "synergy" or "commercial architecture." Say what you did.
- No em dashes throughout.

## Tone in Practice

**Not this:**
"I am a visionary leader with excellence across domains."
"My operational expertise enables scalable growth."
"I specialize in post-merger integration."

**But this:**
"I close deals. I build systems to deliver them. I develop the people who run them."
"I turn fragmented processes into repeatable machines."
"I unified 33 agencies into one go-to-market. I know what works. I know how to fix what breaks."

## Call to Action

The best conversations I've had started with someone saying "we have a problem we can't quite solve." If that's where you are, I'd love to hear it.
