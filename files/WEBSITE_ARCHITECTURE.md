# WEBSITE_ARCHITECTURE.md

## Overview

This document describes the complete structure of your portfolio website. It includes:
1. The physical layout (what goes where)
2. The tone for each section (how it should feel)
3. Example language (so you see the personality we're aiming for)

Think of this as the blueprint. Anti-Gravity will use this to build the actual site.

---

## THE CORE PRINCIPLE

**Your site should feel:**
- Elite-level clean (minimalist, spacious, beautiful)
- Modern (not dated, not flashy)
- Personal (warm, friendly, approachable)
- Intelligent (clever observations, light humor, zero jargon)

**The voice should be:**
- Conversational (like talking to a peer)
- Direct (simplest possible language)
- Witty (clever, but not forced)
- CEO-level (if you're explaining to the smartest person in the room, you use simple language and simple analogies)

---

## PAGE STRUCTURE

Your site is ONE LONG PAGE with 6 main sections + header/footer.

Think of it like scrolling through a story. Each section builds on the last.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐

# SECTION 1: HERO

## What It Is

The first thing people see. Your introduction. Make it count.

## Layout

**Left side (60% of space):**
- Your name (large, clean typography)
- Positioning statement (powerful, direct)
- Optional: One-line tagline or subheading
- One CTA button ("Let's Talk" or "Get In Touch")

**Right side (40% of space):**
- Your professional photo (clean, confident, authentic)
- Lots of white space around the photo

**Visual style:**
- Clean, minimal background (white or very light gray)
- Strong typography (big, readable fonts)
- No clutter. No gradients. No fancy effects.
- Photo is natural, professional, not overly formal

## Tone Guidelines

**Feel:** First impression. Confident but approachable. You're the adult in the room.

**Voice:** Direct, warm, immediately clear. No explanation needed. They know who you are in 5 seconds.

## Example Language

**OPTION A (Direct + Warm):**

**Aaron Nava**

I close major business. I build the systems to deliver. I do it without breaking the culture or the margin.

[Let's Talk]

---

**OPTION B (Slightly More Narrative):**

**Aaron Nava**

I'm brought in to close opportunities and build what's needed to deliver on them. Full arc. No handoffs.

[Get In Touch]

---

**OPTION C (With Personality):**

**Aaron Nava**

I close deals. I build machines. I develop people. And I don't need credit for any of it.

[Let's Talk]

---

**Pick the one that feels most like you, or combine elements.**

The key: Short. Powerful. Clear. No jargon.

---

# SECTION 2: THE FULL ARC

## What It Is

The explanation of what makes you different. Not your resume. Your actual superpower.

## Layout

**Headline:**
- "How I Work" OR "The Full Arc" OR "What I Actually Do"
- Something simple that signals: "Here's what's different about this person"

**Content:**
- 3-4 short paragraphs (not a wall of text)
- Each paragraph focuses on one idea
- Lots of white space between paragraphs
- Optional: Use subtle visual breaks (lines, small graphics) between ideas

## Tone Guidelines

**Feel:** Clear-headed, straightforward, intelligent. This is where you show you think differently.

**Voice:** Conversational, direct, slightly editorial. Like explaining to a peer why your approach works.

## Example Language

**HEADING:**
"The Full Arc"

**PARAGRAPH 1 (The Close):**
I'm brought in to close major opportunities. $3M-$20M formal RFP processes. Once I'm in the room, I have a 90% conversion rate from first call to RFP invitation, and an 85% win rate on the deal itself. I don't hunt for opportunities—I'm brought in to close them. And I close because I don't BS. I understand what's possible. I promise things we can actually deliver.

**PARAGRAPH 2 (The Build):**
But closing is only half the story. I build the operational systems that let complex organizations deliver on those promises. I've scaled from 6 people to 1,200. I've integrated 33 agencies into one operating model. I've grown a $20M capability to $115M while maintaining 15-20% organic growth for four consecutive years. These aren't accidents. They're systems.

**PARAGRAPH 3 (The Develop):**
I develop the people who can run these systems independently. Because the real win is when you can hand it off and it keeps working without you. I don't hoard knowledge. I teach. I mentor. I create teams that are smarter when I leave than when I arrived.

**PARAGRAPH 4 (The Why):**
I do all of this without needing the spotlight. I'm quietly relentless. People notice the impact once I'm gone. And that's exactly how I like it.

---

**Key elements:**
- Short, punchy sentences mixed with longer ones
- Specific metrics (90%, 85%, $115M)
- Simple language (no "operationalize," no "agentic workflows")
- Personality (conversational, confident)

---

# SECTION 3: CASE STUDIES

## What It Is

Proof. Two real stories showing you can actually do what you said.

## Layout

**Structure:**
- Two case study "cards" or sections
- Each has: Headline + Key Metrics + The Story

**Card 1: Circus**
- Headline: "From 6 to 100: Building a Capability"
- Metrics: "2 years | 6→100+ people | $5-10M→$30-45M"
- Story: (your actual narrative)
- Outcome/Lesson: What it taught you

**Card 2: Monks**
- Headline: "From $25M to $115M: Integrating Complexity"
- Metrics: "4 years | 150→1,200 people | $25-35M→$115M+ | 85% win rate"
- Story: (your actual narrative)
- Outcome/Lesson: What it taught you

**Visual style:**
- Clean cards with subtle borders or background shading
- Metrics prominent and easy to scan
- Narrative flows naturally
- Plenty of white space

## Tone Guidelines

**Feel:** Real, specific, human. Not a case study from a consulting firm. A real story.

**Voice:** Direct narrative. Use "I" and "we." Include the actual conflict and how you solved it. Show personality.

## Example Language

[Use the full narratives from CASE_STUDIES_FINAL.md]

The tone is already baked in there. Just present it clearly with metrics visible.

---

# SECTION 4: WHAT PEOPLE SAY

## What It Is

Third-party validation. Real professionals speaking to your impact.

## Layout

**Option A: Carousel/Scrollable**
- Testimonials displayed as cards you can scroll through
- One or two visible at a time
- Clean, easy to navigate

**Option B: Grid**
- 3-4 testimonials per row
- All visible at once
- Can click to expand for full quote

**Option C: List**
- Testimonials stacked vertically
- Each one is a card with quote + name + title
- Simple, clean, easy to read

**Recommendation:** Option C (List format) - it's simplest, most readable, and lets the words shine.

## Content Per Testimonial

For each testimonial:
- **Quote:** The most powerful 1-2 sentences (not the whole thing)
- **Name:** Person's name
- **Title/Context:** What they do or how they know you (optional but helpful)
- **Full quote option:** Link to see the complete testimonial on hover or click

## Tone Guidelines

**Feel:** Authentic, credible, not salesy. These are real people speaking truth.

**Voice:** Don't edit their words too much. Let them sound like themselves. But do pull the most powerful quotes.

## Example Layout

---

**"When pitches get intense, Aaron stays calm, focused, and constructive. He understands both the creative and business sides, which is rare."**

— Federico Duran, SVP Executive Creative Director at Monks

---

**"He developed many procedures that increased productivity, saved the company countless dollars and are still in effect today."**

— Trey Cowhig

---

**"Aaron is someone his entire team can count on. He leads with empathy and clarity, and he has a rare ability to challenge teams to be better without losing the human side."**

— Lara Burniston

---

[Continue with remaining 4 testimonials]

# SECTION 5: ABOUT

## What It Is

Your story. How you got here. What you believe.

## Layout

**Option A: Timeline**
- Visual timeline showing your career progression
- Conill → Joe Agency → Circus → Monks
- Key moments/lessons for each phase
- Numbers that show growth at each stage

**Option B: Narrative**
- Written story format
- Broken into paragraphs or chapters
- Flows like reading a profile

**Option C: Hybrid** (Recommended)
- Timeline on left (visual reference)
- Narrative on right (the story)
- Cleaner, more engaging than either alone

## Content

Should cover:
- Your 15+ year journey in the industry
- The four major builds (and what each taught you)
- Why you do this work
- Your philosophy (culture as infrastructure, AI operationalization, etc.)
- Where you're headed next (optional)

## Tone Guidelines

**Feel:** Reflective, authentic, humble. This is where people understand who you are as a person.

**Voice:** More personal than other sections. Use "I." Include learnings and moments of growth. Show vulnerability (what didn't work, what you'd do differently).

## Example Opening

**"15 Years of Building"**

I've never been good at maintaining. I'm a builder. Always have been. My career has been four major builds—each one bigger, messier, more complex than the last. Each one taught me something I couldn't have learned any other way.

It started at Conill. Smallish company, big ambitions. I built a social capability from zero...

# SECTION 6: LET'S TALK

## What It Is

The call to action. Clear, inviting, no friction. How people contact you.

## Layout

**Option A: Simple & Direct**
- Headline: "Let's Talk" or "Get In Touch"
- Brief statement about what you're looking for
- Email address (clickable link)
- LinkedIn profile link
- Optional: Phone number

**Option B: With a Form**
- Headline: "Let's Talk"
- Brief statement
- Simple contact form (Name, Email, Message)
- Submit button

**Recommendation:** Option A (simpler, less friction, feels more confident)

## Content

**Headline:**
"Let's Talk"

**Copy:**
I'm currently working with [platforms / agencies / companies at inflection points]. If you're closing major business, building complex operations, or navigating a scaling challenge—let's connect.

**Contact Methods:**
- Email: [your email] (make it clickable)
- LinkedIn: [your profile link]
- Phone: [optional]

## Tone Guidelines

**Feel:** Open, inviting, confident. Not salesy. Not desperate.

**Voice:** Direct, warm. This isn't a pitch. It's just: "Here's how to reach me."

## Example Language

**OPTION A (Direct):**

"Let's Talk"

I'm looking for roles where I can drive growth and build systems at scale. If you're at a platform, a major agency, or scaling fast—and you need someone who closes deals and builds infrastructure—let's connect.

Email: [aaron@example.com]  
LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/anava

---

**OPTION B (Warmer):**

"Let's Connect"

I've spent 15 years building things from scratch and scaling them globally. If that's useful to what you're building, I'd love to talk about it.
