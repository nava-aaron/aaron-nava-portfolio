## Website Placement Strategy

These testimonials will appear in two ways:

**Option A: Distributed Throughout**
- Sprinkle 1-2 testimonials after each major section
- Federico after hero section (establishes credibility)
- Jacquelin in case studies section (proves client wins)
- Others scattered throughout to reinforce points

**Option B: Dedicated "What People Say" Section**
- Group all 7 together with competency labels
- Let readers see the full picture of how different people describe him
- More impact because they see the pattern

**Recommendation: Hybrid**
- Feature 2-3 most powerful testimonials throughout the page
- Include "What People Say" section with all 7
- Gives readers both immediate credibility AND deeper proof

## Quote Formatting for Website

Keep testimonials short and punchy on the website. Use only the most powerful 1-2 sentences from each, with full quotes available on hover or in expanded section.

**Example:**
*"When pitches get intense, Aaron stays calm, focused, and constructive. He understands both the creative and business sides, which is rare."* — Federico Duran

Not all the longer details—just the most memorable line that proves the point.
