## CASE STUDY 1: CIRCUS
### "From 6 to 100: Building a Capability from Scratch"

**Timeline:** 2017-2019 (2 years)  
**Starting state:** 6 people, $5-10M revenue, small accounts  
**Ending state:** 100+ people, $30-45M revenue, three transformational accounts  

---

### The Situation

I was at a good place. Solid position. Then I met the CEO of Circus, and something clicked. He had a vision I believed in. Not a "let me scale your existing business" situation—a "let's build something from scratch in the US" situation.

Circus had offices in Mexico and Argentina. But the US? That was blank. Six people. Small accounts. And he needed someone who'd done this before. Someone who could legitimize it, manage the accounts, and actually *build* something real.

I'd just spent years at Joe Agency learning the rigor of the P&L (the hard way). I'd built capabilities at Conill. I could apply all those dots at Circus. It was an easy decision.

### The Challenge

When I showed up, it was all of it. The six people were capable, but they didn't have the infrastructure an agency needs to scale. No business affairs team. No legal. No activations/fulfillment capability. No media team. No influencer network.

But here's the thing—it wasn't broken. It was *incomplete*. We had a vision and a small team. We needed to build the operational backbone to match the ambition.

The real constraint? Credibility and operational capacity. We needed to prove to major brands that we could deliver at scale.

### What I Did: The Build

**The Account Strategy**

I inherited a small Spotify project in the US. But I saw something bigger. I started going to New York monthly. Got deep into their business. They were launching Viva Latino—their big Spanish-language push. They needed social expertise to make it work. I pitched and won a Social AOR with them.

That became the blueprint: take existing relationships, find the gap in our offering, fill it.

Then came Northgate Market. A connection brought us a pitch opportunity. Two-month process. I led it from start to finish, presented the work, orchestrated the team. We won it.

Then California Lottery. This one was different—a formal government RFP, six months of process. But when we won, it changed everything. A five-year government contract. Forecasting certainty. Proof we could deliver at scale.

**The Operational Build**

While winning those accounts, I was building the machine:

- **Finding the people:** Business affairs, legal, media team, influencer team
- **Building the systems:** Activation workflows, fulfillment processes, vendor negotiations
- **Teaching the CEO:** He was deep in LATAM. US operations work differently. I had to show him the implications—contracts, costs, legal requirements, delivery timelines
- **Creating the culture:** I implemented an internship program. I wanted the team to know we were building something that would last

I'd seen what happened at Conill—huge teams where everyone owned one thing. That wasn't going to work here. I wanted startup mindset. Everyone from the CEO to the intern involved. Maniacal about process. Obsessed with doing right by the client and the agency.

**The Turning Point**

About halfway through, I realized it was working. Not because of one thing, but because of everything coming together:

- The CEO's digital-first, social-first vision was resonating with clients
- The team we were building was special—high-performance, lean, everyone invested
- We were winning major accounts
- People believed in it

That's when I knew this wasn't just scaling. This was building something real.

### The Outcome

**The Numbers:**
- Started: 6 people, $5-10M revenue, small accounts
- Ended: 100+ people, $30-45M revenue, three transformational accounts
- Timeline: 2 years
- Major wins: Spotify AOR, Northgate Market, California Lottery (5-year contract)

**What It Meant:**

We went from "small agency with small accounts" to "acquisition-ready operation with major brand relationships." That's why S4 Capital came calling. That's why they bought us. And that's why I moved into the Monks role.

**The Lesson:**

Startup mindset + operational rigor + relentless focus on client outcomes = sustainable growth.

Culture compounds. Process matters. And when everyone is vested in the outcome, you can move fast without breaking things.

I'd carry that into Monks. Try to maintain it across a much bigger, messier organization. It would work—we'd scale to $115M—but I'd learn that there's something special about staying small and focused.

## CASE STUDY 2: MONKS
### "From $25M to $115M: Integrating Complexity at Enterprise Scale"

**Timeline:** 2019-2025 (4-5 years as Global SVP Growth)  
**Starting state:** $25-35M revenue, 150-250 people, heavily siloed, 33 agencies incoming  
**Ending state:** $115M+ revenue, 1,200 people, unified capability, 85% win rate  

---

### The Situation

S4 Capital acquired Circus. Suddenly, I'm in a different world. Not building from six people anymore. I'm integrating five core agencies, with 28 more coming. Each one with their own founders. Their own operating model. Their own belief that they're the best.

The social/digital capability I inherited was fragmented. $25-35M in revenue. About 150-250 people. But they weren't working together. They were working *against* each other.

My mandate: unify the narrative. Create one go-to-market. Make sure that when you pitch a client with a social/digital opportunity, you're presenting one coherent capability, not a dozen different approaches.

Easy, right?

### The Challenge: Ego + Strategic Misalignment

I went to a summit in Nashville where all the founders and leaders of the first five agencies met for three days. They presented what they did. It was incredible—smart people, great work.

But here's what I noticed: they weren't complement each other. They were *competing*.

Each one thought their team was better. Each one wanted to pitch their way. Each one wanted to chase every opportunity that came in.

The real problem? They were thinking like small agencies. We were now part of a $1B organization. We needed to think differently.

They wanted projects ($500K one-offs). I needed retainers ($1.5M+).

They wanted to say yes to everything. I wanted to say no to the noise.

They had their way. I had to show them that there was a better way.

### What I Did: The Integration

**Phase 1: Listen First**

I didn't force anything. I became the liaison. I connected with every founder and leadership team. I asked questions. I understood how they operated, their gaps, their strengths.

Example: HP. One of the big clients Media Monks worked with on projects. They knew HP. They'd worked with them for years. When I started suggesting we could expand into a Social AOR, they pushed back hard.

"I know the client. You don't. This is how it needs to be."

I didn't argue. I listened. I learned what they knew about HP. And then I slowly but surely showed them that our model—our strategists, our project managers, our long-term partnership approach—actually *enhanced* what they already had.

Same with Google. Same with every agency.

**Phase 2: Show the Math**

After a year of working with the first five agencies, the resistance started to break. Not because I convinced them. But because the data showed them.

Better qualification = fewer pitches, higher close rate.  
Focus on bigger opportunities = bigger deals, healthier margins.  
Unified approach = consistency, which clients loved.

Win rate climbed to 85%. That's hard to argue with.

**Phase 3: Prove It Works**

As integrated teams started winning together, the proof was undeniable. I couldn't have won HP's Social AOR without their client knowledge. They couldn't have won it without my operating model. Together? We created something neither could do alone.

That became the playbook. Not "do it my way." But "let's leverage what you know with how we operate."

I became the point of contact for everything social/digital/creative. Other agencies had their points of contact for their capabilities. Everyone knew who to go to for what.

### The Land & Expand Execution

While integrating, I was also growing the business.

I built a dedicated pitch team—20 people. Strategists, creators, the full crew. My job: be the first point of contact for ANY social/digital opportunity across the four main agencies. Understand it. Assess it. Orchestrate the pitch.

For roughly three years (2019-2022), I was personally anchoring 22-25 major pursuits annually. From first phone call to signed contract.

90% of those went from "interested" to "RFP invitation." 85% of them closed.

That's not luck. That's discipline. That's understanding what's possible and what's not. That's building the machine to deliver on every promise.

**The Turning Point**

I tracked the pipeline obsessively. Weekly updates to leadership. And at some point, something remarkable happened:

The social-first capability became the **second highest revenue for the entire organization**.

Not just a capability. The **second biggest money-maker in an 8,500-person, $1B+ company**.

That's when I knew the integration had worked. That's when everyone understood: there really was a method to the madness.

### The Outcome

**The Numbers:**
- Revenue: $25-35M → $115M+ (3.3-4.6x growth)
- Team: 150-250 → 1,200 people (5-8x growth)
- Organic growth: 15-20% YoY for 4 consecutive years (steady, not a spike)
- Win rate: 85% on major pursuits ($3M-$20M)
- Agencies integrated: 16+ with overlapping social/digital capabilities
- Timeline: 4-5 years
- Growth breakdown: 60% organic expansion, 40% from integrations + inbound

**What It Took:**

- Listening before pushing
- Showing the math, not just telling people what to do
- Leveraging their client knowledge + my operating model
- Building a dedicated pitch team
- Being the first point of contact for every opportunity
- Tracking the pipeline obsessively
- Installing qualification discipline (kill projects that don't fit the model)
- Creating a unified narrative across 16+ different agencies

### The Insight

I learned that at enterprise scale, the problem isn't usually execution. It's *alignment*. Get 16 smart leaders aligned on how you win, and the organization moves in one direction. Leave them fragmented, and you waste energy.

I also learned that there's a cost to scale. Circus had something special—everyone vested, everyone involved, maniacal about quality. Monks got bigger, more sophisticated, more profitable. But you lose something in the process. You gain rigor. You lose some of that fire.

If I could go back, I'm not sure I'd take the Monks role. The integration was a PhD-level learning experience. I worked with incredible people. The founder, the CEO—some of the smartest humans I've met. But there's something special about building something small and focused.

That said? No regrets. I learned more in those four years than in any other period of my career.

## Why These Two Stories Matter Together

**CIRCUS** shows: "I can build from zero to significant. Fast. Without losing the culture."

**MONKS** shows: "I can integrate fragmented complexity into a unified, scalable machine at enterprise level."

Together? They prove you're a full-arc operator who gets better as the stakes get higher.

That's what separates elite from competent.
