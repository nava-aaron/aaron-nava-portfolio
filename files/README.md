# Aaron Nava Portfolio Website Framework

## Overview

This is the complete blueprint for Aaron Nava's personal portfolio website. It's designed to position Aaron as a top 10% elite executive—a full-arc operator who closes major business AND builds the systems that deliver on it.

**Target Audiences:**
1. Platform companies (Amazon, Google, LinkedIn, Spotify, Adobe, PayPal)
2. Publicis/Razorfish and major holding company agencies
3. Inflection-point companies (Series B-D scaling rapidly)
4. Selective startups with meaningful revenue/funding

## Core Brand Promise

Aaron is brought in to close major opportunities and build the operational infrastructure to deliver on them. He operates across the full arc: growth/pitches + delivery/systems + client partnerships. He doesn't hand off. He owns it end-to-end.

## File Structure & Purpose

```
/aaron-nava-portfolio/
├── README.md (this file - overview and navigation)
├── POSITIONING.md (core brand voice, value proposition, full positioning statement)
├── CASE_STUDIES.md (Monks + Circus, fully structured with metrics and narrative)
├── TESTIMONIALS.md (strategic selections, positioning by competency)
├── WEBSITE_ARCHITECTURE.md (site structure, sections, information hierarchy, layout flow)
├── COPY_STYLE_GUIDE.md (tone, voice, sentence structure, formatting rules)
├── VISUAL_DIRECTION.md (design references and style notes)
├── HTML_SPECIFICATION.md (responsive design specs, component patterns, technical requirements)
└── ANTI_GRAVITY_PROMPT.md (master instruction for AI to build the entire site)
```

## How to Use This Framework

### For Anti-Gravity (AI Website Builder):
1. Read README.md first (orientation)
2. Read ANTI_GRAVITY_PROMPT.md (master instructions)
3. Reference POSITIONING.md + CASE_STUDIES.md + TESTIMONIALS.md (content)
4. Follow COPY_STYLE_GUIDE.md (voice/tone)
5. Implement WEBSITE_ARCHITECTURE.md (structure)
6. Code to HTML_SPECIFICATION.md (technical requirements)
7. Use VISUAL_DIRECTION.md (design inspiration)

### For Aaron (Updates & Iterations):
- Update CASE_STUDIES.md when you have new metrics or stories
- Update TESTIMONIALS.md when you get new recommendations
- Update POSITIONING.md if your positioning evolves
- Everything else stays stable unless design changes

## Key Stats & Brand Anchors

**The Full Arc:**
- 90% conversion rate: intro to RFP invitation
- 85% win rate: major deals ($3M-$20M, formal RFP processes)
- $115M+ global P&L managed
- 15-20% YoY organic growth for 4 consecutive years
- 33 agencies integrated into unified operating system
- 1,200-person capability at peak
- 4 major department builds from zero (Conill, Joe, Circus, Monks)

**The Pattern:**
You close major business. You build systems to deliver. You develop people who run them. You stay calm under pressure. You don't need credit.

## Visual Direction

Three reference sites provided in VISUAL_DIRECTION.md:
1. mason-wong.com (clean, minimalist, strong typography)
2. mojkomputer.eu (modern, bold, clear hierarchy)
3. shoya-kajita.com (elegant, spacious, storytelling-focused)

The website should feel: **professional, confident, spacious, minimal. Not flashy. Not cluttered. Elite-level clean.**

## Timeline & Next Steps

1. ✅ Framework created (this doc)
2. ⏳ Q&A with Aaron to fill case study details, testimonial selections, specific metrics
3. ⏳ Lock all content in framework files
4. ⏳ Hand to Anti-Gravity with complete specs
5. ⏳ Anti-Gravity builds HTML/CSS website
6. ⏳ Review, iterate, launch

## Questions for Anti-Gravity

Before building, Anti-Gravity should:
- Confirm all positioning language resonates
- Verify case study structure is clear
- Check that testimonial positioning makes sense
- Ensure COPY_STYLE_GUIDE will produce the right voice
- Validate HTML_SPECIFICATION matches VISUAL_DIRECTION
